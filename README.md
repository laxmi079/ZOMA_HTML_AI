# Zomato HTML AI Clone

This project is a **frontend clone** of Zomato, created using only **HTML** and enhanced with the power of **AI**. The idea is to build a fully functional website structure with just HTML, and then use AI tools (like ChatGPT or other code assistants) to enhance the design and functionality of the website.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to create a Zomato-like website that allows users to discover food and restaurants using **HTML** as the main structure. The AI was used to assist in creating the design and adding CSS and JavaScript for interactivity.

### Features
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive and work well across devices.
- **Header Section**: Includes logo, navigation links, and a search bar.
- **Main Section**: Features an image and a search input field to discover restaurants and cuisines.
- **Footer Section**: Includes copyright information.

## How I Built This

1. **HTML Structure**: 
   The project is built with only HTML structure and layout.
   
2. **AI-Powered Styling**: 
   The layout and styling were enhanced using **AI**, which helped with the CSS and JS parts for responsiveness and interactivity.

3. **No Backend Involved**: 
   This project is purely a frontend clone. There is no backend involved as of now, but it's a great foundation to build more advanced features in the future.

4. **Used Tools**:
   - **AI Assistants**: ChatGPT and other AI tools for code assistance.
   - **GitHub**: For version control and hosting the project.
